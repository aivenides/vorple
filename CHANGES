(https://github.com/vorple/inform7/CHANGES).

Release 3.0
===========

- Fixed a bug that prevented a music track from looping if it was started
  when a previous track was already playing
- Added the vorple.audio.pauseBetweenTracks variable to set the duration of the
  pause between tracks in a playlist


Release 3.0 preview (2017-04-29)
================================

Version 3 is a complete rewrite. Instead of Parchment, it's built on top of
Git (https://github.com/DavidKinder/Git) and CheapGlk
(https://github.com/erkyrath/cheapglk) that have been compiled to JavaScript
(https://github.com/vorple/Git and https://github.com/vorple/cheapglk).
The frontend uses Haven (https://github.com/vorple/haven).

The API has changed completely, so individual changes are not specified here.

Version 3 doesn't directly support Undum anymore. With Undum please use
version 2.5.


Libraries
---------

- Replaced the notification/modal library Noty with Toastr and Vex
- Replaced the tooltip library qTip2 with PowerTip
- Added the Flexboxgrid library
- Updated jQuery to 3.1.1


Miscellaneous
-------------

- Inform extensions are split into a separate repository, so dual-licensing
  the entire project isn't necessary anymore: the JavaScript library is now
  using the MIT license and the Inform 7 extensions use the CC-BY license.
